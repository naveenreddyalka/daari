# Prometheus metrics

**Outcome:** Scrape `GET /metrics` for tier and boundary counters.

## Steps

Enable exposition (see config `observability` / prometheus flags in reference). Scrape:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:11435/metrics | head
```

Import Grafana dashboard: `deploy/grafana/daari-dashboard.json`.

Useful series: request latency histograms by tier, `daari_guardrail_trips_total`,
`daari_boundary_decisions_total`.

Two counters worth alerting on:

| Series | Reading it |
|--------|-----------|
| `daari_upstream_retries_total` | Transient upstream failures absorbed by backoff. Rising here while errors stay flat means clients never saw the instability. Rising alongside errors means the failures are not retryable — check for 401s or malformed requests. |
| `daari_cache_false_hits_avoided_total` | L1 hits vetoed by verification. Steady growth is the cache working; a spike suggests the similarity threshold is too loose. |

Retries also appear per-request as `upstream_retry` trace steps with the status and
delay, so a slow request explains its own latency. See
[traces](traces-stats.md) and `upstream.*` in the
[config reference](../../reference/config.md).
